= MODIFIERS/MOD SETTINGS: =

+ Added an Insanity Options menu! This menu will contain adjustable settings for
  the menu, including gameplay tips and enabling/disabling certain spawners for
  DeHackEd monster compatibility. More settings will be added over the course of
  future updates!

+ Added random gameplay tips when the player dies. These are on by default, and
  can be disabled from Insanity Options -> Gameplay Tips, or by toggling
  isur_tips to false in the console.

+ Added a server variable to enable or disable the Spider Mastermind spawner of
  Insanity Survival. This is required for DeHackEd monsters to work in custom
  maps that replace the Doom Spider Mastermind. The spawner is on by default,
  and can be disabled from Insanity Options -> Server Options -> Spider
  Mastermind spawner -> Off, or by toggling isur_spiderdemonspawner to false in
  the console.
