/-------------------------- // // FEATURES: // // -------------------------- //

Insanity Survival is a Doom II co-operative mod for Zandronum! Based on the
weapons and items of Insanity Deathmatch, Insanity Survival replaces your
standard Doom deathmatch things with random insane weapons, several armor types,
wacky powerups, over 1100 gibbing sounds, and most important of all, over 160
different monsters! It can be considered the co-operative 'sequel' to Insanity
Deathmatch.

// Weapons:

- 50 total weapons! 41 new additions and 9 improved versions from the original
  Doom II arsenal!
- All weapons have powered up versions using the Strength Powerup!
- 10 different starting weapons!
- 19 total Big Weapons, the strongest of which can randomly spawn on the BFG
  spot of the map at a time, and the rest can be rarely obtained from cyberdemon
  and spiderdemon monster variants!
- Weapon spawns are mostly randomized in their ammo-categorized spawns!
  (Example: the Rocket Launcher spawn spots now randomly spawn 1 out of 3
   different rocket weapons.)

// Ammo:

- Monsters have a chance to drop ammo. The bigger the monster, the higher the
  chance!
- Some Big Weapons have their own special ammo that can spawn in place of Cell
  Packs.

// Armor:

- Players start with 100 starting armor protecting the player for 67% against
  all damage.
- Several armor types which protect you more or less against different Damage
  Types (Bullets, Nails, Melee, Explosives, Plasma, Rails, BFG, etc.)
- Some smaller Armor pickups have weaker protection, but also give you ammo for
  the weapons they also protect against better.

// Powerups:
- 15 whacky powerups!

// Monsters:

- Over 160 total monsters! Improved Doom II, Heretic and Hexen monsters, a few
  throwback monsters from the golden eras of ZDoom and Skulltag, and a handful
  of new monsters!
- Randomized monster spawns in their monster-categorized spawns!
  (Example: Imp spots now randomly spawn different imp variants.)
- Monsters have a chance to drop ammo, health and armor bonuses, or at a rarer
  chance, even spawn other monsters! Monsters that can gib can rarely spawn a
  resurrect-only Archvile!

definitely bound to come later!
However, I hope you like what is implemented thus far, and look forward to the
next few updates that are coming very Soon(tm)!
